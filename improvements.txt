Fragile Spidering: The spider logic doesn't use a Bloom filter. If a popular torrent is being announced 100 times a second, the spider will attempt 100 database writes/reads a second for the same hash, trashing the disk I/O.

The "Scan" Bottleneck: In enrich.rs, the code storage::list_missing_info scans the database to find work. As soon as you have 50,000 torrents, the application will spend 100% of its CPU just iterating over database keys to find the next item to process.
